# Face Expression Recognition

This project focuses on the automatic classification of human facial expressions using deep learning techniques. The goal is to recognize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise directly from face images.

## üí° About the Project

This notebook demonstrates how to train a deep learning model that can detect and classify facial expressions (e.g., "happy", "angry", "neutral") from grayscale images. It covers preprocessing, data visualization, model design, training, and evaluation.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used in this project:

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Face Expression Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset/data)
- The dataset contains thousands of 48x48 grayscale facial images labeled with emotional categories.

## üß† Techniques Used

This notebook includes the following tools and methods:

- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Image Processing (OpenCV)
- Data Augmentation techniques
- Deep Learning model (CNN architecture using Keras)
- Training, validation, and visualization of loss/accuracy curves

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

The entire project was developed and executed in **Google Colab** with GPU acceleration. The notebook runs independently without external scripts.

## üîó References
